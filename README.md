**Panku Console is a feature-packed real-time debugging toolkit for Godot Engine.** With Panku Console, you can easily interact with your scripts and objects at runtime, whether to cheat, debug, prototype, or just to have fun 😄🎮.

Panku Console is designed to be modular and extensible, and it is easy to add and maintain features. It is also designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so you can use it in your project without worrying about the impact on the final product 🧩🚀.

# ✨ Features
